# Spring Boot 3 & JPA Workshop

A hands-on workshop on building scalable web applications using **Spring Boot 3** and **Java Persistence API (JPA)**. This project covers essential concepts for application development, including data persistence, RESTful services, security, authentication, and performance optimization.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot 3**
- **Database** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2 for testing)
- **Maven** or **Gradle**
